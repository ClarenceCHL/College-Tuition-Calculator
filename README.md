# College-Tuition-Calculator
The goal of this project is to have a program, which runs on the IDE console, that calculates the tuition amount due for college students. There are three types of students included; instate, outstate, and international student. Besides the student type, number of credits taken by each student is another important factor to be considered by the program when calculating the tuition fee. The program also does some basic operations on the enrolled-student list, such as find, add, remove, and print. I hope some of you can find this program interesting and helpful. Enjoy the code!
